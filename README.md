  Welcome to the GitHub repository for Code Crafter's Raspberry Pi IoT-DirFram project!
</p>

## üöÄ Project Description

This project aims to develop software for a Raspberry Pi that automatically executes when connected via USB or UART to retrieve information from an IoT device. The software will gather details such as firmware version, chip model, and voltage usage, compiling them into an XML format. This information can be stored onboard the Raspberry Pi or transmitted to another system for analysis.

My talents lie in conceptualizing backend programs based on how they should operate and how they will interact with stored data. I am strong in anticipating potential issues that may arise in programs and am meticulous in ensuring the logic of my code is sound. I have a vested interest in AI and Cybersecurity and hope to study these fields further. I operate well under pressure and tend to reassure peers in stressful situations since I believe in the principle that a calm mind produces the best results.

I am a Computer Science student. This has allowed me to gain experience and knowledge in the respective field. I am well-versed in data security, having past experiences with data analytics for the SIU. I have extensive knowledge of web development as I have built Defi DApps on ICP with a React front-end. I have also worked with large teams where I would contribute to both the front-end and back-end.

## üìÇ Git Repository
### üìÅ Git Structure (Mono Repo)

Our repository follows a mono repo structure to organize all project-related files and code in a single repository.

### üóÉÔ∏è Git Organization and Management

We use Git for version control, allowing for collaborative development and easy tracking of changes.

### üåø Branching Strategy

We follow the Git Flow branching model, with main, develop, feature, and release branches to manage development and release processes efficiently.

### üèÖ Code Quality Badges

- **Code Coverage:** None
- **Build:** GitHub Actions
- **Requirements:** None
- **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues

## üìà Monitoring

We do not have a server for housing the XML data as it is stored locally on the Raspberry Pi for now, and thus don't need to utilize software such as NodePing for monitoring server uptime and performance.

## üìù Conclusion

With this comprehensive GitHub documentation, we aim to provide transparency and insight into our project's development process, organization, and team members. We welcome collaboration and feedback from the Course co-ordinators, clients, or any other members involved with the project.

## Notes

When Creating a branch, please base it off Dev and push it to Dev, not main when merging.
Please also put the readme in a .gitignore file
